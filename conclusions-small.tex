\section{Conclusions}

Prior research has identified geographical clusters of undervaccinated
populations in many states. However, the potential risk of causing large outbreaks from such clusters is not well understood, and is the motivation of our work. Public health response (e.g., surveillance and field work within such a cluster) is very costly, and therefore, a method to quantify such risk would be an important public health contribution.


We formalize the problem \maxcrit{}
for finding critical clusters for highly contagious diseases that can be prevented by vaccination. 
We design algorithm \algomaxcrit{} and prove a rigorous worst case approximation guarantee for it. Our main technical contribution is a new algorithm for maximizing a submodular function on a network with connectivity constraints, and our algorithm improves on the previous best result for this problem by exploiting the doubling dimension of the network.
Experimental results show that our method performs significantly better than heuristics from public health. Such an approach can help public health agencies prioritize response to the challenges of reduced vaccination coverage.
