\section{Conclusions}
Our work is motivated by public health policy questions of quantifying potential risks of large outbreaks as a result
of reducing vaccination rates in a cluster. We formalize the problem \maxcrit{}
for finding critical clusters for highly contagious diseases that can be prevented by vaccination. 
We design algorithm \algomaxcrit{} and prove a rigorous worst case approximation guarantee for it. Our main technical contribution is a new algorithm for maximizing a submodular function on a network with connectivity constraints, and our algorithm improves on the previous best result for this problem, by exploiting the doubling dimension of the network.
Experimental results show that our formulations perform significantly better than heuristics from public health. Such an approach
can help public health agencies prioritize response to the challenges of reduced vaccination
coverage.
